        <p>While in New York, I was employed in the Charivari Boutique where president of the company, Barbara Weiser, noticed my potential and passion for unique fashion and helped me launch my first fashion collection. My passion for African fashion is
            profound. "Everything begins for me with the print and fabric, which usually has some shine", exclaims Faturoti. My deep African roots, as well as extensive global experience with having lived and worked in New York and Milan have been instrumental
            in her success and international spotlight.</p><br>

            colors, and artwork are his main sources of inspiration.</p><br>
